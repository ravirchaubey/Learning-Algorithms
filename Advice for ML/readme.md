### Problem Statement

In this exercise, you will implement regularized linear regression and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties. In the first half of the exercise, you will implement regularized linear regression to predict the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir. In the next half, you will go through some diag- nostics of debugging learning algorithms and examine the effects of bias v.s. variance.
