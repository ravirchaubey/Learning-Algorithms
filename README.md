## Overview
* Free Projects to learn Data Science and Machine Learning Algorithms
* Covers predictive modeling, data manipulation, data exploration, and machine learning algorithms

## Introduction

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. Python has enough provisions to implement machine learning algorithms in a fast and simple manner. This is a complete project series to learn data science and machine learning using Python. By the end of this hands-on, you will have a good exposure to building predictive models using machine learning on your own.

In this repo, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems.

>The Structure of project and organization of folders and many problem statements has been directly taken from **Respected Sir Andrew NG's** [Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera. Implementation has been done by solo me, `Apart from Andrew NG's Course`, there are many use cases of Machine Learning has been covered in this repo.
